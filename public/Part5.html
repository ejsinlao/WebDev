            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

<div>
  <h3>Q: Rate your experience with the frameworks that you chose.</h3>
    <p>React: 7/10  <br>
        Rails: 3/10 
  </p>
    <h3>Did they perform to your expectations?</h3>
  <p> The frameworks did not perform to our expectation because there were some issues in regards to installation and configuration</p>
    <h3>Were they difficult to install or configure?</h3>
  <p>Ruby on Rails provided some difficulty due to the bugs of the latest Rails version. Alot of issues were created because we had to make sure the Rails and Ruby versions were compatible. Some of us even had to switch computers in order to get the Rails server running.</p>
    <h3>Was it easy to create the page(s) with it?</h3>
  <p> The pages were easy to create because we knew HTML/CSS/JS. Using the React framework on top of that helped expedite alot of our work. The Rails backend was easy as well due to the simple nature of the database.</p>
    <h3>Was the learning curve steep compared with regular HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP? </h3>
  <p> The learning curve from installation and designing is definitely steeper compared to HTML/CSS?JS. A big part was all of the different components that come with Rails and making sure all of them work seamlessly.</p>
    <h3>Would you have done things differently in retrospect?</h3>
  <p>We would have prioritized reading documentation because Rails and React were frameworks we have not used before. </p>
    <h3>Did you regret your choice of frameworks?</h3>
  <p> We do regret the choice of our frameworks simply because we did not have alot of time to learn them. We could have used frameworks we were more familiar with like Angular and Django but decided to learn new frameworks instead. This along with installation difficulties from Rails made the experience more painful that it had to be.</p>
